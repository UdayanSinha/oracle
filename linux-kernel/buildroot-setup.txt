Tested on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS with QEMU x86.

Buildroot official website:
	* https://buildroot.org

1) Download Buildroot and its dependencies.

2) Compile a Linux image:
	* If using WSL:
 		- PATH must be redefined with the Windows paths removed.
   		- Otherwise the compilation will fail.
	* Buildroot uses a defconfig-based setup similar to Linux Kernel.
	* make qemu_x86_64_defconfig
 		- To list available defconfig files: make list-defconfigs
		- To make changes to the default defconfig: make menuconfig
	* make -j16

3) The build output is located at: /path/to/buildroot-dir/output

4) A ready-made script is provided for starting QEMU with the compiled rootfs and kernel:
	* /path/to/buildroot-dir/output/images/start-qemu.sh serial-only
